# loom-daemon-start.sh - Safe start wrapper for the RAW loom-daemon process
# (the autonomous work-finder + main-health-gate host — epic #3809, Phase D
# #3813).
#
# This is NOT the tmux agent pool. `.loom/bin/loom start` (loom-start.sh)
# manages the Manual-Orchestration-Mode tmux pool; THIS script backgrounds the
# `loom-daemon` binary itself, which hosts the autonomous forge-polling work
# finder (#3810) and the reactive main-health gate (#3812). The two process
# models are independent and can coexist.
#
# It:
#   - locates the loom-daemon binary,
#   - runs the (advisory, never-blocking) host-sleep check (#3350),
#   - starts a plain reliability daemon with BOTH autonomous loops OFF by
#     default (matching the ecosystem-wide opt-in / default-off contract:
#     LOOM_WORK_FINDER unset => off, LOOM_MAIN_HEALTH_GATE unset => off). Opt in
#     explicitly with --work-finder / --health-gate, or hand control to
#     .loom/config.json -> autonomous with --from-config (#3911),
#   - on macOS, backgrounds the daemon as a launchd LaunchAgent (#3972) in the
#     resolved per-user domain (`gui/<uid>` when a GUI login is active, else
#     `user/<uid>` — #4130, so it can also be (re)started headlessly over SSH)
#     so it survives the launching session's death instead of a plain `nohup ...
#     &`; on a systemd Linux host, installs + enables a `systemd --user` service
#     (#4268) that mirrors the launchd contract (Restart=on-success,
#     disable-on-stop, LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=systemd) — see --no-systemd for the
#     escape hatch; on a non-systemd Linux host (or with --no-systemd) it stays a
#     plain nohup background job,
#   - arms the autonomy-loss watchdog (#4011): on Darwin a SECOND launchd
#     StartInterval job, on a systemd Linux host a `<unit>-watchdog.timer` +
#     `.service` pair (#4260 sub-issue D) — both drive the SAME
#     loom-daemon-watchdog.sh payload on a recurring interval, independent of
#     the daemon job/unit, so a wedged or dead daemon still gets checked,
#   - backgrounds the daemon and writes a PID file (.loom/.daemon.pid),
#   - persists the resolved invocation flags to .loom/.daemon.flags so
#     `loom-daemon-update.sh` (#3968) can restart with EXACTLY the same
#     autonomy flags after a rebuild — never wider,
#   - surfaces the singleton-guard refusal (#3806) legibly instead of leaving a
#     silently-exited background process.
#
# Default is FLAGS-OFF: a bare `loom-daemon-start.sh` does NOT auto-dispatch
# sweeps. This is a deliberate safe default — enable autonomy explicitly.
#
# macOS session-bootstrap hazard (#3972): a plain `nohup "$DAEMON_BIN" &`
# leaves the process wired into the LAUNCHING SESSION's Mach bootstrap
# namespace. When that session dies (a Claude Code session crash, a closed
# terminal, a dropped SSH connection) the daemon and every child it spawns
# start failing XPC lookups to trustd (cert verification -- `gh` TLS errors)
# and opendirectoryd (`getpwuid` -- "No user exists for uid N" from `git`),
# with NO crash and no obvious log signal beyond those downstream errors. This
# is why "start it from a terminal that might die" is unsafe on macOS. This
# script defaults to loading the daemon as a `launchd` LaunchAgent on Darwin
# specifically to avoid that failure mode; see --no-launchd below for the
# escape hatch and daemon-reference.md Operability for the incident writeup.
#
# launchd domain (#4130): the LaunchAgent is loaded into the domain
# resolve_launchd_domain() (lib/launchd-domain.sh) picks — `gui/<uid>` when a
# GUI (Aqua) login session is active (byte-for-byte the pre-#4130 behavior),
# else the background per-user `user/<uid>` domain that sshd instantiates, so a
# headless / SSH-only start no longer fails with `error 125: Domain does not
# support specified action`. Override with LOOM_LAUNCHD_DOMAIN.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh                 Reliability daemon (both loops OFF)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --work-finder   Enable the autonomous work finder
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --health-gate   Enable the main-health gate
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --work-finder --health-gate   Both loops ON
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --from-config   Enable per .loom/config.json only
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --no-work-finder    Force work finder OFF (explicit)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --no-health-gate    Force health gate OFF (explicit)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --foreground    Run in the foreground (no PID file)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --no-launchd    macOS only: use legacy nohup instead of a LaunchAgent
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --no-systemd    Linux only: use legacy nohup instead of a systemd --user service
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --print-plist   Print the LaunchAgent plist that WOULD be installed and exit (no side effects)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --print-unit    Print the systemd --user unit that WOULD be installed and exit (no side effects)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --help
#
# Environment:
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN     Path to the loom-daemon binary (else auto-detected)
#   LOOM_SOCKET_PATH    Override the daemon socket (default ~/.loom/loom-daemon.sock)
#   LOOM_WORK_FINDER / LOOM_MAIN_HEALTH_GATE  Respected when already exported
#   LOOM_DAEMON_LAUNCHD  macOS only: 0/false/no forces the legacy nohup path (same as --no-launchd)
#   LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD  Linux only: 0/false/no forces the legacy nohup path (same as --no-systemd)
#   LOOM_SYSTEMD_UNIT    Linux only: override the systemd --user unit name (default loom-daemon.service)
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_LABEL  Override the watchdog job identifier (macOS: LaunchAgent
#                        label, default <daemon label>-watchdog; systemd Linux:
#                        service/timer unit basename, default <daemon unit>-watchdog)
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SECS  Watchdog check cadence in seconds (default 300) —
#                        macOS StartInterval / systemd OnUnitActiveSec+OnBootSec
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL   macOS only: override the LaunchAgent label (default com.rjwalters.loom-daemon)
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_DOMAIN  macOS only: pin the launchd domain (e.g. gui/$(id -u) or
#                        user/$(id -u)); honored verbatim, else auto-resolved
#                        gui→user (#4130). A pinned domain that does not resolve
#                        fails loudly at bootstrap rather than falling back.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_PATH        Full override for the rendered plist's PATH (#4172).
#                        Used verbatim -- no canonical fallback is appended. For
#                        a host that needs a wholly custom PATH.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_PATH_EXTRA  Extra dir(s) to prepend onto the canonical minimal
#                        PATH (#4172) instead of overriding it entirely -- for
#                        a host that needs one or two additional dirs (e.g. a
#                        project-local toolchain) without inheriting the WHOLE
#                        invoking shell's interactive PATH.
#   LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT  Machine mode (Epic #3835 Phase 3b, #4229): set by
#                        the `scripts/loom` dispatcher to the resolved
#                        ~/.local/share/loom checkout before it execs this
#                        script. When set, the plist's WorkingDirectory and the
#                        pid/flags home resolve from THIS path -- not from
#                        $PWD -- so `loom start` manages the SAME machine-wide
#                        singleton daemon no matter which repo it is run from.
#                        Direct invocation of this script (the existing dev
#                        workflow) never sets it and is unaffected: $PWD-based
#                        find_repo_root() stays the fallback. See
#                        defaults/docs/machine-dispatcher.md.

# render_launchd_plist <label> <daemon_bin> <workdir> <log_path>
# Prints the LaunchAgent plist XML to stdout. Mirrors the hand-written plist
# that validated the #3972 fix during the incident
# (~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rjwalters.loom-daemon.plist): RunAtLoad=true
# (the daemon also comes back after a reboot/re-login, not just a session
# death -- strictly more durable than the pre-#3972 nohup contract, which
# didn't survive a reboot either).
#
# KeepAlive is `{ SuccessfulExit: true }` as of the supervised restart primitive
# (#4054, Phase 2 of #4017): launchd relaunches the job ONLY when it exits with
# status 0, and leaves it down on any non-zero exit. This is what lets the
# daemon END and reliably COME BACK on demand -- the `RestartDaemon` IPC request
# (loom-daemon restart) is the ONLY path that exits 0, so it is the only thing
# that trips a relaunch. Crucially this PRESERVES the old no-crash-loop semantics
# of KeepAlive=false: a crashed/panicked daemon, a SIGTERM'd operator stop (exit
# 143), and a SIGINT/Ctrl-C (exit 130) all exit NON-ZERO, so launchd does NOT
# respawn them. Making the exit code carry intent (daemon side, #4054) is also
# what closes the SuccessfulExit/bootout race (Curator Finding 1): an operator
# stop exits non-zero, so launchd never relaunches it during the stop window --
# "an operator stop stays stopped" no longer depends on bootout timing. The
# bootout in loom-daemon-stop.sh is demoted to belt-and-braces (it still unloads
# the definition so it does not come back at the next login).
#
# LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=launchd is baked into the plist env so the daemon can
# PROVE it is supervised before it will exit for a restart. It is hardcoded here
# (not harvested from the caller's env) so it lands in EVERY rendered plist --
# and, conversely, is ABSENT from the nohup path (which never renders a plist),
# so an unsupervised daemon correctly refuses to exit on a restart request
# (nothing would bring it back). Because it survives in the plist, the relaunched
# daemon still sees it.
#
# The PATH baked into the plist is DETERMINISTIC (#4172), not derived from the
# invoking shell's PATH. It used to be "$PATH:<fallback>" -- the invoking
# shell/session's ENTIRE interactive PATH prefixed onto a fallback set -- so a
# re-render (e.g. a `loom-daemon-update.sh --relaunch` run from an interactive
# terminal with a large project-specific PATH) silently replaced whatever PATH
# the live plist carried with whoever's shell happened to run the roll:
# non-hermetic, non-reproducible across hosts/sessions, and able to let an
# unrelated toolchain earlier in that PATH shadow the binaries the daemon and
# its sweep children expect (gh/git/cargo/python3). resolve_plist_path() (see
# above) instead resolves, in order: an explicit LOOM_DAEMON_PATH override
# (verbatim), LOOM_DAEMON_PATH_EXTRA prepended onto the canonical minimal PATH,
# or the canonical minimal PATH alone (~/.local/bin, ~/.cargo/bin, Homebrew,
# standard bin dirs -- the same fallback set this always carried, just no
# longer prefixed with the invoking shell's PATH). It is computed exactly once
# per script invocation into $PLIST_PATH_VALUE and logs its choice to stderr.
# Every already-exported LOOM_* / GH_TOKEN / GITEA_TOKEN / FORGE_TOKEN var is
# still forwarded verbatim so the launchd job sees EXACTLY the autonomy flags
# and auth this invocation resolved -- never wider, never narrower (#3972 AC:

# Prints the `systemd --user` service unit to stdout. Pure string rendering --
# safe to call on ANY platform (used by --print-unit for inspection/testing); the

# separately, below. This is the Linux mirror of render_launchd_plist:
#
#   * Restart=on-success is the exact analog of the launchd
#     KeepAlive:{SuccessfulExit:true} contract (#4054): systemd relaunches the
#     service ONLY when it exits with status 0 (the RestartDaemon primitive), and
#     leaves it down on any non-zero exit -- a crash/panic, a SIGTERM operator
#     stop (143), a SIGINT/Ctrl-C (130) -- so it preserves the no-crash-loop
#     semantics while making the one deliberate clean exit the only relaunch
#     trigger. Crash relaunch (Restart=always/on-failure) is deliberately NOT set
#     here -- that is watchdog territory (sub-issue D of #4260).
#   * [Install] WantedBy=default.target + `systemctl --user enable` is the
#     RunAtLoad=true analog: the service comes up on login (and, with
#     `loginctl enable-linger`, after a reboot).
#   * LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=systemd is baked in (hardcoded, not env-harvested) so
#     the daemon can PROVE it is supervised before it exits for a restart (#4054,
#     recognized daemon-side by detect_supervisor() since PR #4298 / #4267) -- and,
#     conversely, is ABSENT from the nohup path, so an unsupervised daemon
#     correctly refuses to exit on a restart request.
#   * The PATH baked in is the SAME deterministic value as the launchd plist
